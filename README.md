# 🚀 CrowdFund Smart Contract

## 📌 Project Title
**CrowdFund – A Simple Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding DApp**

---

## 🧾 Project Description
CrowdFund is a minimalistic Ethereum smart contract that enables individuals or teams to raise funds for their projects in a transparent and decentralized way. Contributors can easily send Ether, and the project creator can only withdraw funds once the predefined funding goal has been reached.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To democratize fundraising by eliminating intermediaries and giving full transparency, trust, and control to both project creators and backers — all powered by blockchain technology.

---

## 💡 Key Features
- **Secure Contributions:** Funds are safely held on-chain until the funding goal is reached.  
- **Transparent Tracking:** Anyone can verify total funds and contributors on the blockchain.  
- **Owner-Only Withdrawal:** Only the project creator can withdraw funds after reaching the goal.  
- **Minimal Gas Usage:** Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add **refund functionality** if the goal is not met within a deadline.  
- Integrate **frontend DApp interface** using React or Next.js.  
- Implement **milestone-based funding** with community voting.  
- Add **ERC20 token support** for multi-token crowdfunding.  
- Enable **project listings** and **user profiles** for multiple campaigns.

2. Set the funding goal (in Wei) during deployment.  
3. Call `contribute()` and send Ether to support the project.  
4. Once the goal is reached, the owner can call `withdrawFunds()` to collect the funds.
